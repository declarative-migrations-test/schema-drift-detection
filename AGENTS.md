Use focused pull requests. Keep database tests deterministic and self-cleaning. Never weaken a failing convergence, rollback, drift, locking, atomicity, CLI, or MCP assertion merely to make CI green. Never commit credentials or production data. Resolve conflicts semantically with both sides and relevant history.
